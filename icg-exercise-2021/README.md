# Illustrative Computer Graphics Exercise

## Course Procedure

The ICG course will be held on campus unless changes in the
regulations of the university require a change back to online
teaching. The course consists of a **lecture**, held weekly and a
**practical exercise**. The exercise consists of programming tasks, in
which you implement techniques presented in the lecture. At the end of
the Semester there will be an oral examination.

## Prerequesites

For this course you must

1. Be able to program in Java. **This course assumes you know how to
   program.** No general introduction will be given!
2. Have a portable computer on which you can run Processing. If you do
   not have such a device, please contact us to arrange a device.
3. Be able to work independantly and address technical issues on your
   own before consulting us. We introduce processing commands and
   principles in the lecture, but it is expected that you read the
   documentation for the details.
4. Be able to use the version control system `git`. We highly suggest
   you read the book about git located
   [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). You do not need advanced
   knowledge of git, but you should be able to commit files, push/pull
   and tag commits as a finished submission.

## Lecture

The lecture is held weekly in ZT702.

## Exercise

In the exercise you will use Processing 3, a framework for graphical
programming, to solve a given task. You will be given a Processing
Sketch with some existing code as well as reference images. In the
giveaway you will find one or more places marked with "// TODO" as
well as a description of what you are supposed to do in a
comment. After completing the task your output should look very
similar to the reference images. Because many sketches will include
some random element, you will probably not exactly match the
reference, but you should be close.

The exercise is held after or interleaved with the lecture. You will
be given time to work on the given task and be able to ask us
questions there. Work which you do not complete during the sessions is
homework for next week. We check the submission at the beginning of
each lecture.

**It is not possible to grant extensions on task completion!** Since
subsequent exercises often contain solutions of previous ones, once
the new exercise is handed out, we cannot consider submissions of
previous ones.

### Grading 

Your submissions will be graded as "pass" or "fail" when you show us
the result at the beginning of a lecture. Students who present all
sketches working and on time will recieve a bonus of 0.3 on their
final grade.

### Submission

You will recieve a new sketch via the ICG Exercise repository. Your
submission must be presented in the next lecture. Screenshots or
images are not accepted. You must present a running program, which
generates the result when executed.

Also note that each submission must be self-contained and cannot rely
on external files. Also it should not contain anything relating to
previous tasks or unrelated files. After a sketch is finished, be sure
to not touch it anymore! You will need it on hand in the exam (see
below). Remember: **Get a new sketch for each assignment from the
repository**.

## Oral examination

The oral examination consists of a 20 minute interview on campus, in
which you will be asked questions about:

1. The material discussed in the lecture: Any topic can be enquired
   and you should be able to demonstrate your understanding of the
   matter. Unless specified otherwise, terms should not be memorized,
   but principles need to be understood.
2. Your solution to the practical exercise: The examiner will choose
   an exercise to discuss and you will need to present your result via
   screen sharing and explain what is going on. You should also be
   able to explain what pieces of the code you wrote, how they work,
   and how this is related to the lecture material. Failure to produce
   an exercise result will result in a reduction of your grade or a
   fail.
